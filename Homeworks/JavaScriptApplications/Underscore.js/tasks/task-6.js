 Create a function that:
 *   **Takes** a collection of books
 *   Each book has propeties `title` and `author`
 **  `author` is an object that has properties `firstName` and `lastName`
 *   **finds** the most popular author (the author with biggest number of books)
 *   **prints** the author to the console
 *	if there is more than one author print them all sorted in ascending order by fullname
 *   fullname is the concatenation of `firstName`, ' ' (empty space) and `lastName`
 *   **Use underscore.js for all operations**
